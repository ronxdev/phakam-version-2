#phakam

This is the main frontend for phakam. an Initiative launched by one of the daughters of Desmond Tutu. The site is still in progress and will be updated as we go. The languages I used to build so far are html, css, javascript and jquery. In order to speed up the process and optimally deliver something aesthetic I have chosen to use materialize library - from which I got the template. Many changes moving forward from the original layout. This project will be launched live under a different name. You can find the real name of the project and organization by viewing the files in the repository.
